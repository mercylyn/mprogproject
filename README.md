# Programming Project - Project proposal

## Problem statement ##
The expansion of the airports in the Netherlands is a hot topic. The top executive of KLM states: "If the aiport in Lelystad does not open, Schiphol airport has to expand." (1).

However, the number of flights keeps increasing and the CO2 emission increases steadily.

What is the impact of the current aviation on the environment? Are there alternatives for travelling?

## Solution ##
