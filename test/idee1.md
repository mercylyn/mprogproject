## Travel CO2 emission meter

Observe the air pollution of your travel in Europe by car, train and airplane. Also, perceive the effect of the climate change on the temperature of the country.

## Problem statement ##
The expansion of the airports in the Netherlands is a hot topic. The top executive of KLM states: "If the airport in Lelystad does not open, Schiphol airport has to expand." (1).

However, the number of flights keeps increasing and the CO2 emission increases steadily.

What is the impact of the current aviation on the environment? Are there alternatives for travelling?

## Solution ##
Visualizing the CO2 emission of the travel by train, car and airplane.

### main features ###
* select country to travel to in Europe
* show: CO2 emission travel by train, car and airplane
* show: temperature change of selected country

The CO2 emission is the minimum viable product (MVP).

## Prerequisities ##

### data sources ###
* https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data
* https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/lijst-emissiefactoren/
* https://www.schiphol.nl/en/developer-center/page/our-flight-api-explored/

### external components ###
* d3-tip
* datamaps

### similar visualizations ###
* https://www.milieucentraal.nl/duurzaam-vervoer/vliegen-of-ander-vakantievervoer/

On the website of milieucentraal the amount of CO2 during the vacation is visualized in a bar graph. It is possible to calculate the CO2 emission for 1, 2 or for persons. This is a nice feature.

### hardest parts ###
* scraping data: flights, train travels
* implementing the possibility for users to select a real time travel (like 9292.nl)
